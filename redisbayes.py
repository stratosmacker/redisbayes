    Naïve Bayesian Text Classifier on Redis.

    I wrote this to filter spammy comments from a high traffic forum website
    and it worked pretty well.  It can work for you too :)

    For example::

        >>> import redis
        >>> import redisbayes
        >>> rb = redisbayes.RedisBayes(redis.Redis(), prefix='bayes:test:')
        >>> rb.flush()
        >>> rb.classify('nothing trained yet') is None
        True
        >>> rb.train('good', 'sunshine drugs love sex lobster sloth')
        >>> rb.train('bad', 'fear death horror government zombie god')
        >>> rb.classify('sloths are so cute i love them')
        'good'
        >>> rb.classify('i fear god and love the government')
        'bad'
        >>> int(rb.score('i fear god and love the government')['bad'])
        -9
        >>> int(rb.score('i fear god and love the government')['good'])
        -14
        >>> rb.untrain('good', 'sunshine drugs love sex lobster sloth')
        >>> rb.untrain('bad', 'fear death horror government zombie god')
        >>> rb.score('lolcat')
        {}

    Words are lowercased and unicode is supported::

        >>> print english_tokenizer("Æther")[0]
        æther

    Common english words and 1-2 character words are ignored::

        >>> english_tokenizer("greetings mary a b aa bb")
        [u'mary']

    Some characters are removed::

        >>> print english_tokenizer("contraction's")[0]
        contraction's
        >>> print english_tokenizer("what|is|goth")[0]
        goth
